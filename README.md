# Agent-P: Your AI Academic Ally

## Inspiration
Agent-P emerged from a desire to reduce the administrative burden on educators, freeing up their time for students and research.

## What We Learned
Key learnings during development include:
- Leveraging fetch.ai's agent framework for autonomous agents.
- Utilizing Groq's models for natural language understanding.
- Multiagent architectures for task management.
- Optimizing academic workflows using AI.

## How We Built Agent-P
Agent-P is a multiagent system using fetch.aiâ€™s framework and Groq's language models, developed in Python. The core agents include:

1. **Email Management Agent**: Monitors .edu emails, summarizes communications, and sends daily digests for critical decisions.
2. **Lecture Preparation Assistant**: Analyzes presentation materials and generates potential student questions and answers.
3. **Research Progress Monitor**: Tracks research students, identifies roadblocks, and suggests support.
4. **Grading Assistant**: Grades both MCQs and descriptive responses, providing statistical insights on student performance.

These agents work together, integrating with platforms like Canvas.
